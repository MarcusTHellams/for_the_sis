Homework 4: Mobile Application 
Need to modify the tutorial app (https://github.com/ccoenraets/cordova-tutorial) so that:
1. There are two input boxes, one for first name and one for last name.
2. The search results should be those names with the first name containing the string in the "first name" input box AND with the last name containing the string in the "last name" input box. One of the input boxes could be empty, but not both.
3. The search results are not displayed unless there are at least two characters in one of the input boxes. The two characters should be between 'a' and 'z' and have no space between.  If a string starts and/or ends with spaces, those spaces should be ignored.
4. When neither input box has no less than two characters as described above, the search results should be removed
